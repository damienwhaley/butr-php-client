finish user_user (list next, then search results).

Need to refactor the history code like setHistoryUserUser
Finish off the error_modal  error_modal_message from everything.

// FARM pages to do next:
- #system_module.php
- #system_partition.php
- #security_registration.php
- #security_role.php
- #system_table.php
- security_messages_permissions.php
- security_docks_permissions.php
- security_dock_items_permissions.php
- security_dock_subitems_permissions.php
- security_dock_tabs_permissions.php

// FARM pages to test:

// PHPUnit to go:
- PageDock.class.php (need to wait until UI is in place)
- PagePagination.class.php (need to wait until UI is in place)

* think I need to change the way the pages load. instead of using insertcontent(),
  it should use the history set and then you trigger the change in history
  which triggers the insert content call.

* do like frame breakout check to make sure it's loaded in butr page.
  check for page url and if it's not /butr.php then go to butr.php with the url.

* try uploads with the AJAX.

* make sure PSR-0 is implemented in coding rules.
* try to do PSR-1 and maybe PSR-2 (but I think there's things that I do differently).
