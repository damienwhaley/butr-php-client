// FARM pages to do next:
- #system_module.php
- #system_partition.php
- #security_registration.php
- #security_role.php
- #system_table.php
- security_messages_permissions.php
- security_docks_permissions.php
- security_dock_items_permissions.php
- security_dock_subitems_permissions.php
- security_dock_tabs_permissions.php

// FARM pages to test:

* add getters for all the add/modify classes.

* think I need to change the way the pages load. instead of using insertcontent(),
  it should use the history set and then you trigger the change in history
  which triggers the insert content call.

* do like frame breakout check to make sure it's loaded in butr page.
  check for page url and if it's not /butr.php then go to butr.php with the url.

* try uploads with the AJAX.

* set the page title and the admin menu title from a function call in the page.

* make sure PSR-0 is implemented in coding rules.
* try to do PSR-1 and maybe PSR-2 (but I think there's things that I do differently).
